    content: `Fashion is not commerce. Fashion is experiment. Fashion is the physical manifestation of creative research.

    We don't sell clothes. We create moments of transformation. Each piece is a timestamp of creative evolution, not a product.

    ASKEW is an experimental fashion laboratory. We pursue the limits of fashion through rigorous research and uncompromising methodology.

    The laboratory is where fashion meets science, where fabric meets philosophy, where destruction creates beauty.`,

    title: 'ON DESTRUCTION AS CREATION',
    content: `Every act of creation requires destruction. To make something new, something old must die.

    In the laboratory, we embrace failure as a teacher. Each failed experiment brings us closer to revelation.

    Pattern deconstruction is not about breaking things - it's about finding the beauty in broken things.`,

    title: 'TIME AS MATERIAL',
    content: `Time is not linear in fashion. A garment can exist in multiple temporal states simultaneously.

    We design for the future while honoring the destruction of the past. Each collection is a time capsule of NOW.

    Fashion that changes over time, that degrades beautifully, that evolves with wear - this is living fashion.`,

    title: 'THE VOID PHILOSOPHY',
    content: `Negative space is not empty space. It is potential space. It is the space where imagination lives.

    In fashion, what we don't create is as important as what we do create. The absence defines the presence.

    TWIST • BALANCE • REPEAT - The twist creates tension, the balance creates harmony, the repeat creates rhythm.`,

  {

    title: 'COMMERCE IS DEATH',
    content: `The moment fashion becomes commerce, it dies. Price tags are tombstones.

    We don't sell because selling diminishes the work. Each piece exists as art, as experiment, as statement.

    After exhibitions, after documentation, maybe one piece finds an owner. Not through transaction, but through understanding.`,
